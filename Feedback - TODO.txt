Disclaimer !!! Observer != Achievement




not every GameObject needs Observer

observers can have multiple subjects

get subject raw pointer


Ex1 
Player -> Health component == Subject
       -> Die command == when pressed lose health

UI -> ShowLives Component == Observers(Health component)


event args basic struct -> inherit depending on the event
